A small C++ library containing convenience methods for initializing UDP sockets and transmitting data.  
So far intended for compilation using GCC. Will add possibility to compile with Visual Studio Build Tools in the future.

Also contains user programs for measuring the round-trip delay between two hosts.

The API documentation can be found [here](https://tbs-ualberta.github.io/data_transmission/classdata__transmission.html).

**Installation:**
```
git clone https://github.com/tbs-ualberta/data_transmission.git  
cd data_transmission
chmod u+x ./install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```
